            <p>India’s vast and boundless array of traditional dress is full of aesthetic beauty. Made from many states of the country are fabrics, weaving processes, embellishments, styles and accessories of multiple sorts. A compelling epic about craftsmanship, culture or legacy tells a story in each piece. The land is a centre of heritage mode. Its diversity was a muse for a number of notable connoisseurs of fashion. In addition to the western clothing, Indians have their own ethnic attire like dhoti, kurta, sari, sherwani, turban etc. Dhoti is a piece of cloth draped around the waist by men. Dhoti is sometimes called Laacha or Dhuti. Kurta is one of India’s famous men’s ethnic clothing. It is usually worn on holidays today by folks. Likewise, the saree is the favourite choice for Indian women. A saree is a long robe, gracefully drawn by women around their bodies. Saree is Indian women’s most trendy clothing worldwide. Indian women are mostly seen in lovely sarees during religious and cultural events. However, due to their convenience, the sarees are substituted by salwar suits for the preferred daily wear</p>

            <p>In India, religious beliefs and practices are distinguished by diversity. Secularism in India means the equality of treatment by the State for all religions. By the 42nd Constitutional Amendment Act in 1976, India is a secular state. The Indian subcontinent gave rise to four significant religions worldwide, namely Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism. Religion has played an essential part in India’s culture throughout India’s history. The law and tradition foster religious plurality and tolerance in the nation; the right to freedom of religion has been proclaimed as an essential right by the Indian Constitution.</p>

            <p>Though Hindi is the most commonly used language in India, there exist many other languages too. As diverse the country is, each state has its distinct language, such as Kannada, (which, is spoken in Karnataka), Malayalam, (which, is spoken in Kerala), Tamil, is spoken in Tamil Nadu, etc. Apart from the fact that each state has its own language, it is also worth mentioning that some states in India have more than one and sometimes more than three prevalent languages. Due to this, it would not come as a surprise that most Indians are bilingual (or sometimes Multilingual), and can effortlessly handle more than one or two languages..</p>

            <p>The festivals of India, too, are worth mentioning. As said earlier, each state has its own festivals, from the fragrant Onam, the festival of Kerala, which is characterized by the making of a floral carpet to the Pôhela Boishakh, (the onset New Year according to the Bengali calendar), the festivals are both colourful and equally incredible.</p>
